# MicroFlash
MicroFlash is an easy and interactive way to flash Espruino onto a NodeMCU or ESP8266. MicroFlash contains:
- Custom Esptool management system to always have the latest version of esptool.
- A simple command line interface to flash the device.
- Automatic downloads of the latest version of espruino for the device.

Why MicroFlash?

Mainly, for beginners, using Esptool with file offsets and split files is pretty painful. Not only that, having to update espruino
but not remembering the exact offsets was just too much of a hassle. MicroFlash takes care of all of that for you and simply
presents you with a 4 question setup to get started.

Is it slower?

No, in fact, MicroFlash is a lot faster than the standard Esptool because it runs on a 4x faster baud rate for non windows machines and
up to 2x baud rate faster on windows machines.

Is it reliable?

Since MicroFlash uses Esptool to flash the device, it is very reliable. Esptool is created by the same developers who created the ESP8266.
